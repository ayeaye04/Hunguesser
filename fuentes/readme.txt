OCCAMS ERASER is a wish in font form. In his book, "Never Bet Against Occam: Mast Cell Activation Disease and the Modern Epidemics of Chronic Illness and Medical Complexity," Doctor Lawrence B. Afrin explores his pioneering work with Mast Cell Activation Disease/Syndrome (MCAD/MCAS) and its extraordinary complexity, including the fascinating medical detective-story of its diagnosis. Occam's Razor (boiled down: the simplest of competing theories should be preferred) is the obvious reference in the book's title, and here I hope my bit of wordplay is similarly transparent. If the cool logic of William of Ockham can get us here, I hope similarly disciplined thinking can one day get us out.

PLEASE CONSIDER HELPING: Paula Repko, who inspired this font, needs your help. They suffer from MCAS and other chronic conditions, and have had an extremely difficult year. Visit paula.cumberlandgames.com

OCCAMS ERASER is a full US-Keyboard Small-Caps stressed poster font with some extras for additional European alphabets. Enjoy!
